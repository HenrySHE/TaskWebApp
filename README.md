## Some problems that need to be improved

1. In the first page, I didn’t write passing the task to the next page because I can’t find out a very efficient and secure way to pass the task name

2. The second page, about the timer, I make the timer be invoked when user click "pause" button..(I know it is not user-friendly and confusing), but the timer is 

3. Actually, this webpage doesn't support different kinds of device, cause I use lots of "fixed positions".

4. [About the code format] Actually, I should put those CSS files and js file separately, but because the time is limited, I just make them into one single file.

5. In CSS part, actually I can have more code reuse.
